# Excel-Hypothesis-testing-confidenceInterval-
Did Gender pay gap analysis among employees by hypothesis testing. This sample data consists of 178 row of a company named as spark fortress co. 

Wanted to find whether there is a huge pay gap or is it a good company for everyone to work in. So did an hypothesis analysis on salary of male and female.
Since the sample was independent with unknown variance so we used T-Statistic for the analysis.
Did analysis on 3 metrics:
1. Overall employees
2. Employees below age of 35
3. Employees above age of 35.

We found out that in all the metrics there was no gender pay gap.
